Raw Data Acquisition:

Start with collecting raw MIDI files.
Preprocessing:

Convert MIDI files to a structured format (e.g., arrays) with midi_to_array.py.
Extract advanced musical features (harmony, rhythm patterns) with feature_extraction.py.
Augment data to enhance model training with data_augmentation.py.
Validate preprocessed data for consistency and quality.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose a model architecture (RNN, Transformer, GAN, VAE) based on the musical task.
Train the model using the processed and augmented data.
Utilize model_utils.py for training utilities and evaluation_metrics.py for performance evaluation.
Music Generation:

Use the trained model to generate new music sequences.
Apply post-processing techniques to refine the output and convert it to MIDI/audio format.
Analysis and Evaluation:

Analyze generated music with music_analysis.py to assess musicality, creativity, and similarity to training data.
Visualize music structures and model internals with visualize_music.py for insights into the generation process.
Iteration and Refinement:

Based on evaluation, refine models, preprocessing, and generation strategies.
Iterate through the model training and music generation steps with adjustments for improvement.
